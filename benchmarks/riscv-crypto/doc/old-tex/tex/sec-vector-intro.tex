This document describes the proposed {\em vector} cryptography
extension for RISC-V.
All instructions proposed here are based on the Vector registers.
The instructions are designed to be highly performant, with large
application and server-class cores being the main target.
A companion document ``Volume I: Scalar \& Entropy Source Instructions'',
describes
cryptographic instruction proposals for smaller cores, which do not
implement the vector extension.
