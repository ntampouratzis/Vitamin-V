Presence of the cryptography extension in any form is indicated
by bit $10$ of the {\tt MISA} CSR.
i.e. bit ``K'', because ``C'' is taken and ``K'' is for Kappa, the
first letter of the ancient Greek word krupt√≥s,
meaning ``{\em hidden}''.

\note{
The exact cryptography extension feature groupings and profiles
are still under discussion.
