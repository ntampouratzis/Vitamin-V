== Introduction

This document contains additional information for engineers implementing
or using the RISC-V cryptography extension.

NOTE:   The following discussion is not a _requirement_. We are simply
providing supplementary information that is intended to be helpful for
implementation and optimization of certain tasks, and provides partial
rationale for certain ISA features.
