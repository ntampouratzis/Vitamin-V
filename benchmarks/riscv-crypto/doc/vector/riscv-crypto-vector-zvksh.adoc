=== `Zvksh` - ShangMi Suite: SM3 Secure Hash

Instructions for accelerating
functions of the SM3 Hash Function.

The SM3 secure hash algorithm is specified in _32905-2016: SM3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm_
cite:[gbt:sm4]

There are other various sources available that describe the SM3 secure hash.
While not the final version of the standard,
link:https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8998.html[RFC 8998 ShangMi (SM) Cipher Suites for TLS 1.3]
is useful and easy to access.

All of these instructions work on 256-bit element groups comprised of
eight 32-bit elements.

Implementations with VLEN < 256 require LMUL>1 to combine 32-bit elements from register groups
to provide all eight elements of the element group.

// The instructions will be most efficient on implementations where `VLEN`â‰¥256.
// They will also provide substantial benefit on implementations where
// `VLEN`=128, but will require an `LMUL`>1 in order to combine elements 
// within a register group to form the full element group.
// Implementations with `VLEN`<128 might not be as efficient and should
// consider the existing
// Scalar Cryptography Extensions, specifically `Zkne` and `Zknd`,
// for accelerated cryptographic operations.

To help avoid side-channel timing attacks, these instructions shall be implemented with data-independent timing.

The number of element groups to be processed is `vl`/`EGS`.
`vl` must be set to the number of `SEW=32` elements to be processed and
therefore must be a multiple of `EGS=8`. +
Likewise, `vstart` must be a multiple of `EGS=8`.
