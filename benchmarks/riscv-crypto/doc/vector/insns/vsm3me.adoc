Description::
Eight rounds of SM3 message expansion are performed.


The sixteen most recent 32-bit message words are read in as two
eight-element groups from `vs1` and `vs2`. Each of these words is
swapped from big endian to little endian.
The next eight 32-bit message words are generated,
swapped from little endian to big endian, and are returned in
an eight-element group.

[NOTE]
====
The endian byte swapping of the input and output words enables us to align with the SM3
specification without requiring that software perform these swaps.
====

// NOTE
// ====
// For the best performance, it is recommended that implementations have VLENâ‰¥256.
// When VLEN<EGW, an appropriate LMUL needs to be used by software so that elements from the 
// specified register groups can be combined to form the full element group.
// ====

// The number of element groups to be processed is `vl`/`EGS`.
// `vl` must be set to the number of `SEW=32` elements to be processed and
// therefore must be a multiple of `EGS=8`. +
// Likewise, `vstart` must be a multiple of `EGS=8`.

[NOTE]
====
Preventing overlap between `vd` and `vs2` simplifies implementations with `VLEN < EGW`.
This restriction should not have any coding impact since the algorithm requires these
values to be preserved for generating the next 8 words.
