# RISC-V Cryptography Extension

*RISC-V cryptography extensions standardisation work.*

This is a modified version of https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto to port it in COSSIM simulator in the context of the Vitamin-V H2020 project. 
The updated RISC-V Crypto Benchmarks can be executed on physical RISC-V hardware supporting the necessary crypto extensions.

## Benchmarks

See [`benchmarks/README.md`](benchmarks/README.md) for how to get started with the benchmarking flow.
