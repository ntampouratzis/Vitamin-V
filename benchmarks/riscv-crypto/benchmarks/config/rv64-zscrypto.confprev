# This config supports the baseline architecture, all of Bitmanipulation
# *and* the *proposed* standard Scalar cryptography extensions.
#
# Much of the Scalar crypto extension is expected to build on the
# bitmanip extension, hence it is important to work out the subset of
# bitmanip which is useful to crypto.
